In order to use QT Designer windows in python, you must use PyQt to reformat them. Otherwise, you will be stuck with a C program.

first, change your directory to where your UI is.

then type (for windows):
    "pyuic4 -o outputFileName.py inputFileName.ui"

NOTE:
    code is rewritten every time pyuic4 is run!!

QtCore & QtGUI: Main Modules!!!

class Ui_Form = Ui Code!
setup() = Create UI
retranslate() = Set attributes
